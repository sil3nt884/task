This project will be  demonstrating what I have learnt with the udmey
course for react.

***
**State management** <br>
 useState hook can be used to manage state within the components, state can be passed into <br>
different components, however when updating state we should be careful when updating state
as its queue and could lead to untended states.
***


**Other hooks** <br>
useEffect is another react hook, used to update the DOM where a chance has been made from some user action or something
has updated in the background.
***

**JSX/TSX** <br>
JSX or TSX is a declartive syntax like HTML with small differences, such as you can create your 
own component and use it as it was part of syntax for example we could have 
````
<div>
<Card>


</Card>
</div>
````
We can also add our own attributes to the  component so that it can be used, as this custom
component is actually a function call and so with normal functions you can pass parameters to it.
***

**Styled component** <br>
Styled components library a common library that is used to create components with unique CSS tags
so that the css classes don't get applied to each and every component by accident.
